-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In hte code dolder:

Parameter_settings: Perform some hyperparameter settings.

ARMHGNN.py: The main program file.

model.py: Defines our model.

data_process.py: Performs some data pre-processing and training sample sampling.

random_walk_beigh.py: Sampling Neighbor Nodes through Random Walkthrough.

DeepWalk.py: Based on the network structure, use the deepwalk algorithm to generate the initial embedding of nodes

computer_metapath.py: The construction of heterogeneous graphs and the definition of metapath extraction algorithms.

metapath_neigh_seek.py: Extract metapath using computer_metapath.py.

application.py: Including the setting of two downstream tasks and experimental methods.

node_classification_model.py: Detailed process of downstream task node classification.

node_clustering_model.py: Detailed process of downstream task node clustering.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how to use this project:
*Step-1: Choose any compiler that can compile Python programs (vsCode is recommended)

*Step-2: First, set the hyperparameters in the P.py file as needed.

*Step-3: Second, Run the metapath_neigh_seek.py file to extract a fixed number of metapath instances for each node, which is convenient for later aggregation and use.

*Step-4: Run the random walk file - random_walk_neigh.py to extract neighboring nodes for each node.

*Step-5: Run the main program file - ARMHGNN.py Learn the embedding representation of nodes in heterogeneous graphs through our defined model. It should be noted that It is best to use a GPU with a memory of no less than 24GB.

*Step-6: After obtaining the embedded representation of nodes, the application.py file can be used to test their performance in downstream tasks. Both downstream tasks are written in the application.py file, so when testing a downstream task, it is necessary to comment out another startup command.

Note: Please ensure that all required packages have been installed before testing.
